# HW2: Responsive Portfolio

## The Project

This site was built to demonstrate the fuctions of responsive design, and how they will perform across different types of displays. 

To account for end user experience across various devices, the web page will adjust its formatting to deliver an optimized experience. 

Bootstrap elements such as navigation bar menus will automatically adjust to browser size. 

Figure 1: At a width of 992 pixels, the browser will display the full navigation bar.
